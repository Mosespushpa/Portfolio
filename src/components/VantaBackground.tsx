// This file is intentionally left blank as it is being deleted.
// If this change type were "delete", the content would not be needed.
// For "update" operations, providing empty content effectively deletes it if the tooling handles it that way,
// or it ensures the file is empty if it's not deleted.
// Given the instruction to remove, this signals the intent for the file to no longer be part of the project.
